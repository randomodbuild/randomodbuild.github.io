If you are reading this, you have probably noticed that this website is now located at <a href="https://www.randomodbuild.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">www.randomodbuild.com</a> instead of the older randomodbuild.tk. The reason for this is because my .tk domain lapsed. 

Yes, I even made a point about this; how you must cancel a month in advance and then re-register your .tk domain if you want it to remain free. But, I forgot to remind myself, and the domain expired. Sure enough, when I went to renew it, there was a $9 fee.

So, instead of paying $9 for a year of a crappy .tk domain, I paid $8.16 for a much better .com domain (for a year). From my previous experience, Freenom will make randomodbuild.tk free again in about a month, and then I can setup redirects to this new domain name. Yes, this is annoying, my SEO (what little this obscure website had) is lost, for the most part, and now I am actually paying for a domain name. But the future of this site seems more secure.

In the future, I might set this website up to use a Handshake TLD. If you don&#8217;t know what this is, here is a great resource: <a href="https://learn.namebase.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://learn.namebase.io/</a> Essentially, Handshake aims to decentralize the root DNS zone. The protocol is 100% decentralized, anybody can run a node or mine HNS. I have secured the TLD randomodbuild/ and may utilize it for this site in the future. Of course the ICANN domain will remain, as browser tech needs to improve (DANE, DNSSEC) for non-ICANN domains to be safely used.

That&#8217;s about it! If you have any other questions feel free to leave a comment below.
